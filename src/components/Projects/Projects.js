              description="FPTUPay is an e-wallet project aimed at enhancing services for students at FPT University
              campuses. The project offers fast and convenient money transfer, deposit, withdrawal, and
              school fee payment services. It addresses the issue of withdrawing money from FAP to the
              wallet, allowing the schoolâ€™s bonuses for students to be directly transferred to the wallet
              without the need for application or waiting. The project employs microservices and utilizes
              Java for backend development and JavaScript for mobile and frontend development. The
              environment is run on Kubernetes (k8s) and includes built-in tools such as Rancher, ELK,
              Grafana, Longhorn, Kafka, Jenkins, Sonarqube, Argo-cd, Minio, Harbor (Registry), and
              Debezium to support operations. FPTUPay is poised to provide superior student services and is
              the first university in Vietnam to have its own e-wallet."
